# javascript and classes

What is Object-Oriented JavaScript?
OOJS is a programming style where we organize code around objects, which contain properties (data) and methods (functions) â€” similar to how we describe real-world things.

In JS, everything is object-based, and it supports object-oriented features like:

Classes

Inheritance

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Polymorphism

###
ðŸ§± JS is Prototype-Based
JavaScript is not class-based like Java/C++, but prototype-based.

But since ES6, JS introduced the class syntax to make it easier to work with.
